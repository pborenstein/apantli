# Documentation Audit - October 7, 2025

## Executive Summary

Two specialized documentation agents (`docs-artichoke` and `double-oh-doc`) independently reviewed the Apantli documentation against the current codebase. Both agents identified critical gaps where the implementation has outpaced documentation, particularly around dashboard features and API endpoints.

**Key Finding**: The documentation framework is strong, but the codebase has evolved significantly. The most critical issues are missing API endpoint documentation and incorrect tab counts in multiple files.

---

## Critical Issues (Both Agents Agree)

### 1. Missing API Endpoints

**Status**: Three endpoints exist in code but are completely undocumented

| Endpoint | Method | Purpose | Location in Code |
|:---------|:-------|:--------|:-----------------|
| `/stats/daily` | GET | Daily aggregated statistics with provider breakdown | server.py:554-649 |
| `/stats/date-range` | GET | Get actual date range of data in database | server.py:652-676 |
| `/chat/completions` | POST | Alternate path for chat completions | server.py:187 |

**Impact**: Dashboard features rely on these endpoints, but API users have no way to discover or use them.

**Both agents flagged this as Priority 1.**

---

### 2. Incomplete Endpoint Parameters

**Current Documentation**: Only documents `hours` parameter for `/stats` and `/requests`

**Actual Implementation** (server.py:351, 426):
```python
async def stats(hours: int = None, start_date: str = None,
                end_date: str = None, timezone_offset: int = None)

async def requests(hours: int = None, start_date: str = None,
                   end_date: str = None, timezone_offset: int = None)
```

**Missing Parameters**:
- `start_date` (ISO 8601 date: YYYY-MM-DD)
- `end_date` (ISO 8601 date: YYYY-MM-DD)
- `timezone_offset` (minutes from UTC)

**Impact**: Users cannot replicate dashboard's date filtering functionality via API calls.

**Both agents flagged this as Priority 1.**

---

### 3. Dashboard Tab Count Incorrect

**Files with Wrong Count**:
- CLAUDE.md line 48: "three tabs (Stats, Models, Requests)"
- API.md line 635: "Three tabs"

**Reality**: **Four tabs** (Stats, Calendar, Models, Requests)

**Impact**: Confusing for both humans and LLMs trying to understand dashboard structure.

**Both agents flagged this as Priority 1.**

---

### 4. Static Files Directory Undocumented

**Exists in Code**:
- server.py:174: `app.mount("/static", StaticFiles(directory="apantli/static"), name="static")`
- Contains: `alpine.min.js` (44KB), `alpine-persist.min.js` (837 bytes)

**Missing from Documentation**:
- Not in project structure
- No explanation of Alpine.js dependency
- No mention of why files are self-hosted vs CDN

**Impact**: Users don't understand dashboard JavaScript dependencies.

**Both agents flagged this as High Priority.**

---

### 5. CLAUDE.md Technical Inconsistencies

**Issue 1 - Dashboard Location**:
- Line 17: Says server.py contains "dashboard HTML"
- Line 44: Correctly says "from templates/dashboard.html"
- **Contradiction**: Can't be both

**Issue 2 - Tab Count**:
- Line 48: "three tabs" (wrong, should be four)

**Impact**: LLMs using CLAUDE.md as context will have wrong mental model of codebase.

**Both agents flagged this as Priority 1.**

---

### 6. Missing `.env.example` File

**Current State**: `.env` exists (gitignored) but no example file for new users

**Standard Practice**: Provide `.env.example` showing required variables

**Recommended Content**:
```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-proj-your-key-here
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-api03-your-key-here
```

**Impact**: New users must read docs to know what environment variables to create.

**Both agents flagged this as High Priority.**

---

### 7. Undocumented Dashboard Features

**Features Implemented But Not Documented**:

**Calendar Tab** (entirely missing from README/CLAUDE.md):
- Monthly calendar grid with daily cost heatmap
- Click any day to see provider breakdown
- Month navigation controls
- Keyboard accessibility (Enter/Space keys)
- Heatmap coloring algorithm (cost-based)
- Timezone-aware date handling

**Date Filtering** (mentioned minimally):
- Custom date range picker (start_date/end_date)
- Quick filter buttons (Today, Yesterday, This Week, etc.)
- Timezone offset handling
- Filter state persistence in localStorage

**Request Filtering** (basic mention only):
- Search filter (model names and content)
- Provider dropdown filter
- Model dropdown filter
- Cost range filter
- Summary statistics for filtered results
- Combined filter behavior

**Other Features**:
- Dark mode support
- Sortable columns in all tables
- Provider cost breakdown visualization

**Impact**: Users have no idea these features exist. Dashboard is far more capable than documented.

**Both agents flagged this as High Priority.**

---

### 8. Streaming Implementation Status Confusion

**README.md line 267**: "Streaming responses are supported."

**ARCHITECTURE.md lines 427-434**: Lists streaming as "Future Consideration"

**Reality** (server.py:218-262): **Fully implemented** with chunk accumulation and post-stream logging

**Inconsistency**: README says it works, ARCHITECTURE says it's planned.

**Both agents flagged this as Medium Priority.**

---

### 9. netifaces Dependency Not Explained

**Found in Code**:
- pyproject.toml line 12: Lists `netifaces` as dependency
- server.py:736-767: Used for network interface detection

**Missing from Documentation**:
- Why this dependency exists
- What it does (displays all available network addresses on startup)
- Installation notes (may need compilation on some systems)
- Fallback behavior if import fails

**Both agents flagged this as Medium Priority.**

---

### 10. Auto-Refresh Behavior Documentation Unclear

**Documentation Says**:
- README.md line 282: "Auto-refreshes every 5 seconds for Stats tab"
- CLAUDE.md line 48: "Auto-refreshes every 5 seconds for Stats tab"

**Agent Findings Differ**:
- **docs-artichoke**: Doesn't mention specific implementation concerns
- **double-oh-doc**: Questions whether explicit 5-second timer exists (looks for Alpine.js `$watch` instead)

**Reality**: Needs code verification to confirm exact refresh mechanism.

**Priority**: Low (functionality is correct, just implementation details)

---

## Moderate Issues

### 11. Database Index Documentation Missing from CLAUDE.md

**DATABASE.md** documents three indexes properly:
- `idx_timestamp`
- `idx_date_provider`
- `idx_cost`

**CLAUDE.md** has schema table but **zero mention of indexes**

**Impact**: Developers reading CLAUDE.md won't know about indexing strategy.

---

### 12. Config Example Mismatch

**README.md line 167**: Shows `claude-sonnet-4` mapping

**Actual config.yaml**: Has `claude-sonnet-4-5` with different model ID

**Impact**: Copy-paste examples won't match running system.

---

### 13. Cost Field Names Wrong in CONFIGURATION.md

**CONFIGURATION.md line 268**: Shows `input_cost_per_1k` and `output_cost_per_1k`

**Reality** (server.py line 343): Returns `input_cost_per_million`

**Impact**: Wrong field names in documentation.

---

### 14. "Future Enhancements" Lists Implemented Features

**README.md lines 463-469** lists as future:
- Provider cost trends over time ← **Calendar tab already does this**
- Enhanced request detail view ← **Expandable rows already exist**

**Impact**: Confusing - makes features seem planned when they're implemented.

---

## Minor Issues

### 15. Inconsistent Table Formatting

- README.md uses left-aligned headers
- API.md uses left-aligned headers
- CLAUDE.md has mixed formatting

**Fix**: Standardize all tables to left-aligned headers.

---

## What's Working Well

**Both Agents Praised**:
1. Overall structure (README → detailed docs pattern)
2. API.md thoroughness (excellent examples, clear response formats)
3. DATABASE.md comprehensiveness (good maintenance guidance)
4. ARCHITECTURE.md visual diagrams (flow diagrams are helpful)
5. Consistent voice (technical, factual, no marketing fluff)
6. Good cross-referencing between docs

---
